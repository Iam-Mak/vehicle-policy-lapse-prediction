# Vehicle Policy Lapse Prediction


## Why the predicting Vehicle Policy Lapses Matters
Rising vehicle policy lapses are a significant business issue. When a policy is canceled, recurring premium revenue stops immediately, and the customer’s lifetime value is reduced because future renewals no longer occur.

Policy lapses also increase operating costs, as acquiring new customers requires substantially more spending on marketing, sales efforts, and commissions than retaining existing customers.

In addition, a high lapse rate makes the insurance portfolio less stable and less predictable, which can negatively affect overall profitability and how the company is perceived by management and investors.

The use cases covered areas such as identifying potentially churning policyholders, predicting the chance of a new customer coming on board, predictions to improve the claims processing

## Key Challenges

- Lapses usually occur due to customer inaction (missed renewal or payment) rather than explicit cancellation, making intent difficult to observe.

- Clear lapse signals often appear very close to the renewal or due date, leaving limited time for effective intervention.

- Customer sensitivity to premium changes at renewal varies widely and is difficult to estimate in advance.

- Many lapse drivers (financial stress, vehicle usage changes, policy relevance) are not directly observable in available data.

- The financial impact of lapses is uneven, with high-value and long-tenure policies causing disproportionate revenue loss.
